```

## Build & Flash

Since you've installed ESP32 boards, you can simply select your board, compile and flash. 

For MyZhaZha's PCB or you have no idea which board you should select, simply select **ESP32 Dev Module**. *(If you've installed many version of ESP32 boards library, I suggest the Official ones.)*

Some boards may stuck while flashing and inform you that you should perform power **SYNC**.You should make sure that your board is properly connected to your computer *(not simply connected to provide power)* , and hold **BOOT(FLASH)** and tap once **RST(EN)** before releasing boot.You may need to use extra wires to do that.If you still don't know how to deal with that, you can **ask chatGPT or deepseek**.
